# Python Guidelines
This repository will serve to put forth guidelines and examples of best practices.

## Style Guide
Try to follow PEP 8
* https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

Easiest way to help yourself follow PEP 8 is to give up control to a code formatter such as Black “The Uncompromising Code Formatter” from the Python Foundation.

2.	Use of “main” function: https://github.com/nicholashennen/python_guidelines/blob/main/main_function.py
